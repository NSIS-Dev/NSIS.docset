<h1>BringToFront</h1>

<hr>

<p>Makes the installer window visible and brings it to the top of the window list. If an application was executed that shows itself in front of the installer, a BringToFront would bring the installer back in focus.</p>

<p>Recent Windows versions restrict the setting of foreground windows. If the user is working with another application during installation, the user may be notified using a different method.</p>

<h2>History:</h2>

<p>Added in NSIS v1.1a</p>
