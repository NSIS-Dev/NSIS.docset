<h1>RequestExecutionLevel</h1>

<hr>

<p>Specifies the requested execution level for Windows Vista and Windows 7. The value is embedded in the installer and uninstaller's XML manifest and tells Vista/7, and probably future versions of Windows, what privileges level the installer requires. <em>user</em> requests a normal user's level with no administrative privileges. <em>highest</em> will request the highest execution level available for the current user and will cause Windows to prompt the user to verify privilege escalation. The prompt might request for the user's password. <em>admin</em> requests administrator level and will cause Windows to prompt the user as well. Specifying none, which is also the default, will keep the manifest empty and let Windows decide which execution level is required. Windows Vista/7 automatically identifies NSIS installers and decides administrator privileges are required. Because of this, none and admin have virtually the same effect.</p>

<p>It's recommended, at least by Microsoft, that every application will be marked with the required execution level. Unmarked installers are subject to compatibility mode. Workarounds of this mode include automatically moving any shortcuts created in the user's start menu to all users' start menu. Installers that need not install anything into system folders or write to the local machine registry (HKLM) should specify user execution level.</p>
